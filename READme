About the Data
---------------

Several of the new columns contain json. You can save a bit of time by porting the load data functions [from this kernel]().
Even in simple fields like runtime may not be consistent across versions. For example, previous dataset shows the duration for Avatar's extended cut while TMDB shows the time for the original version.
There's now a separate file containing the full credits for both the cast and crew.
All fields are filled out by users so don't expect them to agree on keywords, genres, ratings, or the like.
Your existing kernels will continue to render normally until they are re-run.

Inspiration
Can you categorize the films by type, such as animated or not? We don't have explicit labels for this, but it should be possible to build them from the crew's job titles.
How sharp is the divide between major film studios and the independents? Do those two groups fall naturally out of a clustering analysis or is something more complicated going on?
